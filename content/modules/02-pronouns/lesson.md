# Pronouns: Words That Replace Nouns

## Introduction

Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns in sentences. They help us avoid repetition and make our writing more fluid and natural.

## What is a Pronoun?

A **pronoun** is a word that stands in for a noun or noun phrase. Instead of repeating the same noun over and over, we use pronouns to refer back to it.

### Example Without Pronouns
- **John** went to the store. **John** bought milk. **John** paid for the milk. **John** brought the milk home.

### Example With Pronouns
- **John** went to the store. **He** bought milk. **He** paid for **it**. **He** brought **it** home.

## Types of Pronouns

### 1. Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns refer to specific people or things.

#### Subject Pronouns (Used as subjects)
- **Singular**: I, you, he, she, it
- **Plural**: we, you, they

#### Object Pronouns (Used as objects)
- **Singular**: me, you, him, her, it
- **Plural**: us, you, them

#### Examples
- **I** love pizza. (subject)
- Give **me** the pizza. (object)
- **She** called **him**. (subject and object)

### 2. Possessive Pronouns

Possessive pronouns show ownership.

- **Singular**: mine, yours, his, hers, its
- **Plural**: ours, yours, theirs

#### Examples
- The book is **mine**.
- Is this **yours**?
- The car is **theirs**.

### 3. Demonstrative Pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns point to specific things.

- **Singular**: this, that
- **Plural**: these, those

#### Examples
- **This** is my favorite book.
- **Those** are expensive shoes.
- I want **that**.

### 4. Interrogative Pronouns

Interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions.

- who, whom, whose, what, which

#### Examples
- **Who** is coming to dinner?
- **What** did you say?
- **Which** color do you prefer?

### 5. Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns connect clauses and refer to nouns mentioned earlier.

- who, whom, whose, which, that

#### Examples
- The person **who** called is my friend.
- The book **that** I read was interesting.
- The student **whose** project won is brilliant.

### 6. Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of the sentence.

- **Singular**: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself
- **Plural**: ourselves, yourselves, themselves

#### Examples
- I hurt **myself**.
- She taught **herself** to play guitar.
- They enjoyed **themselves** at the party.

### 7. Indefinite Pronouns

Indefinite pronouns refer to nonspecific people or things.

- **Singular**: anyone, everyone, someone, no one, anybody, everybody, somebody, nobody, anything, everything, something, nothing
- **Plural**: both, few, many, several
- **Singular or Plural**: all, any, most, none, some

#### Examples
- **Everyone** is invited to the party.
- **Some** of the cookies are missing.
- **Nobody** knows the answer.

## Pronoun Agreement

Pronouns must agree with the nouns they replace in number and gender.

### Number Agreement
- **Incorrect**: The students brought **his** book.
- **Correct**: The students brought **their** books.

### Gender Agreement
- **Incorrect**: John lost **her** keys.
- **Correct**: John lost **his** keys.

## Common Pronoun Mistakes

### 1. Subject/Object Confusion
- **Incorrect**: Give the book to **I**.
- **Correct**: Give the book to **me**.

### 2. Vague Pronouns
- **Incorrect**: John told Mike that **he** was wrong. (Who is wrong?)
- **Correct**: John told Mike that **Mike** was wrong.

### 3. Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement
- **Incorrect**: Each student should bring **their** book.
- **Correct**: Each student should bring **his or her** book.

## Interactive Examples

### Example 1: Personal Pronouns
**Original**: "Sarah went to the store. Sarah bought milk. Sarah paid for the milk."

**With Pronouns**: "Sarah went to the store. **She** bought milk. **She** paid for **it**."
