# Feature: Exercise Interaction

## Description
Comprehensive interactive grammar exercise system that supports multiple exercise types, provides immediate feedback, tracks performance, and integrates seamlessly with the learning progress system. This is the core learning functionality that enables users to practice and master grammar concepts through engaging interactive exercises.

## Actors/Roles
- **Student**: Primary user completing exercises and receiving feedback
- **System**: Backend services evaluating answers and tracking progress
- **Teacher**: Secondary user (future) reviewing student performance

## User Stories / Use Cases

### Core Exercise Completion
- As a user, I want to complete different types of exercises (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, identification, sentence construction) so I can practice grammar concepts
- As a user, I want to receive immediate visual and textual feedback on my answers so I understand my mistakes
- As a user, I want to retry exercises I got wrong so I can learn from my mistakes
- As a user, I want to see my progress within an exercise session so I know how much I've completed

### Learning Experience
- As a user, I want exercises to be presented in a clear, accessible format so I can focus on learning
- As a user, I want to track my accuracy and improvement over time so I can see my progress
- As a user, I want exercises to be responsive and work on mobile devices so I can learn anywhere
- As a user, I want to navigate between exercises within a lesson efficiently

### Accessibility & Performance
- As a user with disabilities, I want exercises to be fully accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers
- As a user on slower connections, I want exercises to load quickly and work offline when possible
- As a user, I want my exercise progress to be automatically saved so I don't lose my work
