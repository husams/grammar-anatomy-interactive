# Feature: Quick Actions Panel

## Description
The Quick Actions panel provides users with immediate access to key learning activities directly from the dashboard. It features four primary action buttons that enable users to continue their learning journey efficiently: Continue Learning, Practice Quiz, Anatomy Lab, and Review Session. The panel is designed for quick task initiation and seamless navigation to core learning experiences.
