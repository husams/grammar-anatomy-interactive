# Content Management â€” Grammar Anatomy Interactive

## Content Structure
- **Lessons, exercises, and glossary entries** are stored as Markdown or JSON files in the repository or a headless CMS.
- Each module (chapter) has its own directory with lesson and exercise files.
- Glossary is a single file or collection of entries.

## Example Directory
```text
content/
  modules/
    01-nouns-verbs/
      lesson.md
      exercises.json
    02-pronouns/
      lesson.md
      exercises.json
  glossary.json
```

## Update & Versioning Workflow
- Content updates are made via pull requests or CMS admin interface.
- Each content file includes metadata (title, order, version, etc.).
- Versioning is tracked via git or CMS history.
- Content can be updated independently of app releases.
